## Overview
In this workshop, we explore practical implementations of core computer vision tasks using pre-trained models and custom training strategies. This hands-on guide is perfect for beginners and intermediate practitioners aiming to strengthen their understanding of deep learning for vision-based tasks.

---

## Content Covered
The workshop focuses on the following key areas:

1. **Image Classification**
   - Use of pre-trained models like ResNet and InceptionV3 for classifying images into categories.

2. **Object Detection**
   - Implementing object detection with YOLO (You Only Look Once) models.
   - Drawing bounding boxes and classifying objects within images.

3. **Semantic Segmentation**
   - Performing pixel-level classification to identify precise object boundaries in images.

Each section includes clear explanations, code implementations, and sample data to ensure an easy learning curve.
